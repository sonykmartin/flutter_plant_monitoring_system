# ARAS Automatic Remote Agricultural System

It is an iot based project of a plant monitoring and a controlling system. We know that different crops have different temperature, pressure, humidity and other important conditions for optimum growth and maximum yield. Whenever we are growing a particular crop in our system our system will stabilize and sustain the optimum conditions inside the system using  different sensors and actuators.We take the data of different parameters using sensors like bmp180, ds3231, soil moisture etc. These datas are stored in a database and we can get the optimum conditions for a particular crop from that database. Whenever we are growing a particular plant we just need to set which crop we are growing in the app and the optimum conditions for that crop will be maintained in our system
